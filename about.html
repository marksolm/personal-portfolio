                    Hello and welcome to my site! My name is <strong>Soliman Abdelmalak</strong>, and I’m a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating functional, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I earned my bachelor’s degree in web development in 2022 with a GPA of 3.95 and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in software engineering. While my background includes leadership and operations management, my focus has shifted toward a more creative and technical role where I can fully apply my skills and enthusiasm for technology. </br> <strong>My technical experience</strong> includes <strong>front-end</strong> development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular with TypeScript, as well as <strong>back-end</strong> work using Node.js, RESTful APIs, MongoDB, and SQL. I’m also proficient in programming with JavaScript, TypeScript, and C, and I regularly use tools like Git, Postman, and SoapUI for testing, debugging, and version control. I volunteer by managing a Christian diocese website using WordPress, where I keep content up to date, enhance user experience, and collaborate with clergy and community members to support outreach. Outside of tech, I’m a husband and father of three who enjoys reading, traveling, watching TV, and spending time in nature. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenges that support my growth. Please look at some of my work, and feel free to reach out—I'd love to connect!
