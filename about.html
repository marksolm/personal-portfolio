                    Hello there, and welcome to my site! My name is Soliman Abdelmalak. I'm a Full Stack Developer. I just graduated and earned my bachelor's degree in Web Development. I am working a full-time job as a Dining Manager. I want to change my career and do something I can be more creative at. I have had an interest in technology since my childhood. Therefore, I decided to go back to school and study web development. I gained excellent knowledge and skill from learning coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, API, Angular with TypeScript,  and MongoDB database. That leads me to specialize in creating custom websites for businesses. I am married and have three kids. In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, watching Tv, and being in nature. I love being creative at work and home while enjoying time with my family. I like the problem-solving aspects of development, unlimited educational opportunities, and growth potential. Please look at some of my work, and feel free to contact me anytime.                </h6>
